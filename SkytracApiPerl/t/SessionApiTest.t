This may occur for any API call, due to the authorization header being malformed. It may also occur due to malformed or incorrect JSON structure of the request body. Other more specific reasons are documented on a per API basis below. - 401 (Unauthenticated) - 403 (Unauthorized). If the user is authenticated as a user with the Standard role, but the API call requires the Admin role. - 500 (Internal Server Error)
